A gem is a packaged Ruby application or library. Ruby code packaged in this manner is called a gem. Gems are managed on your computer using the gem command. You can install, remove, and query (amoung other things) gem packages using the gem command.


Creating a gem

The process of turning your code into a gem is a two-part process.The first part is getting your library set up in a directory structure that is suitable for conversion to a gem.

Basic directory structure of a gem
/project_name/lib: this directory contains all of the Ruby code related to the project. 
/project_name/pkg: this is where the gem will be generated. 
/prject_name/tests: this is where any unit or other tests should be stored. 
/project_name/README: this file should contain a summary of the projectâ€”especially the license under which it is being released (feel free to add a separate file for the license). 

Distribution of gems

1)First way is to host the file which people can download and run it.
2)Another option is to host it at RubyForge.org.
3)Or we can have our own server and fire gem_server so that gem can be shared with anyone.
