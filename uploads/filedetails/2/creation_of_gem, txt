A gem is a packaged Ruby application or library. It consists of a name and along with a version. Gems have the ease of easy installation and removal. 

Command to install a gem
gem install gemname.version.gem

Command to uninstall a gem
gem uninstall gemname

Creating a gem

The directory structure of a gem is as follows:
/project_name/lib: this directory contains all of the Ruby code related to the project. 
/prject_name/tests: this is where any unit or other tests should be stored. 
/project_name/README: this file should contain a summary of the project.

The basic element which makes creation of gem possible is gem specification file which has a extension of filename.gemspec

So using command
gem build specificationfilename.gemspec
This command creates a gem including all the folders of our gem.


The basic structure of a gemspec file looks like the following:

# -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
 
Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name        = "filename"
  s.version     = "1.2.2"  
  s.authors     = ["Author_name"] 
  s.homepage    = "http://github.com/carlhuda/bundler"
  s.summary     = "summary description"
  s.description ="gem description"
  s.files = ["gem_filespath"]
  s.email="mailid" 
  s.required_rubygems_version = ">= 1.3.6"
  s.rubyforge_project         = "projectname" 
end


Once the gem has been created using above command. It has to be installed. And after which it can be used.


Consider a example of gem creation for a getting factorial of a number.

We are creating following directory structure first which is as follows:

1)factorial/lib: This will have our file having code. Suppose the filename is 'display.rb' which is withing this folder having all the required code of our gem. Which is as follows:

module FactGem
class Fact
	def initialize(num)
		@num=num;
	end
	def factor()
		f=1;
		(2..@num).each {|i| f=f*i}
		return f;		
	end

end
end

2)factorial/test: having our required unit test code in filename unit.rb.
3)And a file readme.txt for the deatils about the gem.

Next we will create the specification file  which is named as 'factorial.gemspec' follows:
# -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
 
Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name        = "factorial"
  s.version     = "1.2.2"  
  s.authors     = ["Rohini"] 
  s.homepage    = "http://github.com/carlhuda/bundler"
  s.summary     = "The get factorial of a number"
  s.description ="basic things"
  s.files = ["lib/display.rb", "test/unit.rb", "readme.txt"]
  s.email="abc@gmail.com" 
  s.required_rubygems_version = ">= 1.3.6"
  s.rubyforge_project         = "factorial" 
end

We will create the gem using 
gem build factorial.gemspec

next we will install that gem for testing in our system.
gem install factorial.1.2.2.gem

Lets create a file to use that gem suppose that filename is 'check_gem.rb' with following code:

require 'display'
include FactGem
num=Fact.new(4)
puts num.factor()

lets execute this code at terminal:
ruby check_gem.rb

will generate a output
120.


Once the gem is created sucessfully it could be distributed using one of the following options:
1)First way is to host the file which people can download and run it.
2)Another option is to host it at RubyForge.org.
3)Or we can have our own server and fire gem_server so that gem can be shared with anyone.
